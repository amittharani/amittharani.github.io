  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This study explores user needs and pain points in Google Search to identify areas of improvements. The document outlines the insights from the qualitative research, ideas to improve upon the key focus areas like search experience, information quality, etc, and the metrics to be measured for each suggestion.</p>
  <p>We will explore the future of search to address evolving user behaviors, expectations, and emerging technologies like Gen AI, to fulfill Google's mission of improving access to, and organizing, the world's information.</p>
  <h2>User Research</h2>
  <h3>Target Demographic</h3>
  <p>Urban Indian knowledge workers (IT/Analytics) & professionals (Legal/Media/Medical/Finance), aged 21-35.</p>
  <p>Moderate technical proficiency, actively use Search & some advanced tools for personal and professional research.</p>
  <h3>Voice of Users</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Himanshu, 27, works in IT: <p>I prefer reddit over Google as the answers there are not Search Engine Optimized</p></li>
    <li>Deepanjal, 31, Analytics: <p>I can't give feedback or guidance on google search results. I research on perplexity as I can have a normal conversation. Showing sites that game SEO is another issue for me.</p></li>
    <li>Harsh, 21, CA Articleship: <p>My searches often throw multiple answers from different sources and I don't know which ones to trust</p></li>
    <li>Cherisha, 35, Executive Producer (Movies): <p>I mostly rely on books, biographies, teachers, experts, etc for work related research. For personal research - I find information on Google to be too varied and I don't know which source to believe. I default to other sources ex personal connections for specific advice like travel</p></li>
    <li>Sonika, 30, Analytics: <p>Finding a useful resource among the links is a task. Google doesn't directly answer questions. I asked if something is possible to do in google sheets but I had to sift through multiple pages to find my answer</p></li>
    <li>Aesha, 23, Corporate lawyer: <p>When Google highlights the answer from a website, I'm often not sure if I can trust the credibility of that source</p></li>
    <li>Ayush, 28, Preparing for a competitive exam: <p>Math problems - I often go to ChatGPT or Gemini instead of Search for finding solutions and the approach, it saves me time from having to find the right page</p></li>
    <li>Aditi, 30, works in IT consulting: <p>I find instructions are better solved w/ Gemini; Ex step-by-step instructions for an ERP implementation</p></li>
    <li>Upasana, 30, Analytics: <p>Sometimes the results lack critical real time updates. If I look up Wayanad or Florida now, it should warn me about landslides/hurricanes.</p></li>
    <li>Ojus, 29, Doctor: <p>When I search on google, it's always keywords and not in a natural language. I often get paranoid that I might have missed the right keywords</p></li>
    <li>Suraj, 29, Health Coach: <p>When I look for something that I've searched before and don't fully remember, the result ranks change a lot and I sometimes arrive at different conclusions, which confuses me. I also don't remember which links were the useful ones</p></li>
  </ol>
  <h3>My search insights</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>For tracking order, delivery, application status, etc, I want to write the ID in the search box, along with the website name (ex bluedart ) and get the result on the search page itself</li>
    <li>I want to search across the web AND my personal documents on Gmail, Drive, photos, etc instead of searching all platforms independently. Ex "Find all pictures of me on the Great lakes trek"</li>
    <li>I want to find the video and the exact timestamp when a youtube creator talks about a specific topic in a long video (even if they haven't annotated the segments)</li>
    <li>Shopping ads sometimes lead to scam websites. Ex a search for 'comfortable chair'in the UK shows a scam company LITFAD's products. (insight sourced from a youtube video)</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Research Summary</h2>
  <h3>1. Information Reliability</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Users question the source reliability and trustworthiness; also citing SEO manipulation reducing the result quality.</li>
    <li>Ad shopping results can include scam websites</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2. Search Experience</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Hard to find previously useful answer (just an indicator of visited links)</li>
    <li>Users feel under-confident about natural language querying & resort to keyword based search</li>
    <li>Multiple sources have to be checked for simple yes/no queries</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>3. Information Quality</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Missing critical real-time updates (ex natural disasters)</li>
    <li>Featured answer snippet/widget lacks a credibility indicator</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>4. Alternative Preferences</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Reddit for authentic discussions & varied opinions</li>
    <li>AI tools like Gemini for Step-by-step approach, natural language conversations and feedback on results</li>
    <li>Direct integration with websites for tracking (orders/delivery/applications)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Improvements</h2>
  <h3>Reddit over google</h3>
  <p>Users have started appending "reddit" at the end of the query in recent years. Why?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>To find opinions, both for & against the topic, from real people. Ex a laptop purchase decision - seeing both points of view helps them decide vs articles on the web where the author didn't even use the review product and are incentivised to push for products with better affiliate rates. While users can look at multiple articles from different authors, it is less convenient than looking at a single reddit post with different opinions from many people.</li>
    <li>SEO - many find the search results to be corrupted by companies who excel at SEO manipulation. Ex websites updating just the title with 2024 while still recommending 3 year old products. Or a company pretending to review products, with their own product listed as the best. Whereas a high traffic post on reddit is associated with valuable insight.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>When google updates the SEO logic to counter this, it is the authentic websites that focus on actual content, which are unable to keep up, compared to the ones who've mastered SEO</p>
  <p>Users still search on google with the reddit keyword, instead of searching reddit because reddit's search feature isn't good. Reddit has acknowledged that they are working on improving search. In theory, this might lead to a decline in google searches, but the popular argument on the web is that it will be plagued with the same SEO issues as google.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Google can increase the weightage of Reddit over other pages on topics where opinions and discussions matters more than just the answer</li>
    <li>For topics with fewer quality answers or opinions, a widget on the search page can post the user's questions directly on reddit (reddit profile integration required) or other forums. Google can recommend the right subreddits too which have a higher likelihood of quality discussions</li>
  </ol>

<p><b>Focus area</b>: Improves task success for users.</p>

<b>Measurement:</b><br>
<ol>
    <li>Search session duration (lower is better) or #links visited related to the search query [ask success]. This measurement requires identification of similar links/query and access to visited links on the brower</li>
    <li>% search queries where users clicked on reddit [adoption]. % search queries ending at reddit [task success]</li>
  </ol>
<p><b>GTM</b><br>
“Ask on reddit” widget - educate users on widget’s first impression: how to use, what is required from user, etc - modals/interactive tutorials/tooltips etc
</p>
  <h3>Widgets</h3>
  <p>Similar to currency conversion, calculator, stock trends, game scores, etc, build more widgets for commonly asked questions. Ex order/delivery/application tracking: writing the tracking ID and the website name ex bluedart in the search box will show the tracking updates on the results page. This is also useful for the business partners (those who don't intend to run ads on their tracking page) by reducing their traffic and costs. Caveat: solving for bot behavior</p>

<p><b>Focus area</b>: Focus Area: Reduce time and friction for the answer</p>

<b>Measurement:</b><br>
<ol>
    <li>Coverage: common search queries and their share among searches. What % is templatised as a widget</li>
    <li>Adoption: % interaction/impression</li>
 </ol>
<p><b>GTM</b><br>
<ol>
    <li>On Search page: when someone searches for the tracking partner. Nudge users to add the widget on the home screen or search page for the duration of the event (ex till order is delivered, application is approved/denied, a sports is live, etc)</li>
    <li>On Partner site - nudge to add widget on search home / chrome landing page</li>
  </ol>


  <h3>Result accuracy & credibility</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Options on the search result page for users to give feedback on accuracy/usefulness. This is present for AI overview results only, not for other results</li>
    <li>Verified source badge on the results page for websites that can be trusted</li>
    <li>An accuracy/usefulness indicator on the summarized/highlighted answer</li>
    <li>AI tools to fact check flagged content by giving them broader context window, more time to generate result, or elevated access to certain resources</li>
    <li>Platform tools to act on flagged content - making it easy for a fact checker to identify such queries, results shown & feedback</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b>Focus area</b>: accuracy, usefulness & credibility.</p>

<b>Measurement:</b> Change in accuracy/usefulness of flagged content at an aggregate level
  <h3>Storing Search Journey</h3>
  <p>The search box currently indicates if a query has been searched by the user before, and also uses that information to autofill the queries. The visited links are also highlighted in a different color on the results page. This information can be further enriched with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Last visited date</li>
    <li>An overview/summary of the site</li>
    <li>Highlights - A browser feature to allow highlighting content on a webpage or even add notes. This is especially helpful when users don't want to organize their information into separate notes/documents but end up researching the topics again.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Focus Area</strong>: Task success - reduces time spent searching for the answer</p>
<strong>Measurement</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>[Highlights feature] - adoption (% users highlighting content)</li>
    <li>Search query duration for visited queries</li>
  </ol>
<strong>GTM</strong>
  <p>Educate users for highlights discovery & how to use, where they can find the highlights, etc through modals/interactive tutorials/tooltips</p>
  <h3>Solving Information sparsity</h3>
  <p>Some of the ways to better address search queries, especially when the information is sparse:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The intent behind the search isn't clear. If the query is presented with more details, it will lead to a concrete & accurate answer</li>
    <li style="list-style-type:circle">Interactively prompt users for query refinement. Ex:when a user searches for "Slack login error" the result page can prompt for clarification on the nature of the error.</li><br>
    <li>Complex queries for which an answer isn't available</li>
    <li style="list-style-type:circle">Crowdsourcing answers: Similar to reddit/quora, but questions are generated by google to complete it's knowledge base. Use all the user information to profile them and identify their areas of expertise. Aggregate answers across users and verify through AI or user feedback. Verification is an easier problem to solve than finding the answer</li><br>
    <li>The facts are available, but scattered across the web / not structured well enough. There's data which needs to be organized into information.</li>
     <li style="list-style-type:circle"> I imagine this to be an active area of focus at Google already, to continue improving it’s knowledge graph builders to gather, structure and verify fragmented information </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Other problems to solve</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>AI overview: when to summarize answers on the result page vs when to present links, since more users now expect answers instead of resources to find them. This is a complex problem of balancing user expectations, answer accuracy, and monetisation.</li>
    <li>Educating users about advanced search filters like quotes, 'site:' 'filetype:' search tools like 'any time' 'size' etc which can significantly improve their results.</li>
    <li>Imbibing confidence that the search query was understood and the user doesn't have to worry about using the right keywords.</li>
  </ol>

  <h5>Problem</h5>
  There are 2 types of content on Kuku FM: non-fiction and fiction. Most of it is locked behind a paywall. Users acquired for non-fiction had a decent free to paid conversion, while <b>fiction users had a low intent to pay, nearly 1/5th of non-fiction</b>. This meant way higher Customer Acquisition Costs for fiction. If we were to grow this business vertical sustainably, we had to <b>improve our conversion manifold and generate more revenue</b>.
  <br><br><h5>Approach</h5>
  On deep-diving and conducting many user interviews, we identified that users are still unfamiliar with our fiction library and mostly interested in listening to the show they were acquired for. Non-fiction isn’t plagued by this issue as the users recognize the popular books on our platform and therefore, are willing to pay for the entire library.
  We set out to validate this learning by introducing a <b>new a la carte plan</b> called ‘Pay for show’ – <b>users only need to pay for the show they like</b>, at a lower price.
  <br><br>
  <img src="img/portfolio/pay_for_show1.png" style="width:270px;height:532px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:10%" alt="text"> 
  <img src="img/portfolio/pay_for_show2.png" style="width:270px;height:532px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" alt="text">  
  <br><br><h5>Experiment Setup</h5>
  To check business viability, we designed an experiment to fare Annual + Pay for Show subscription page against the Annual Plan page. We compared the following metrics separately for fiction and non-fiction:
  <br>1.  Conversion
  <br>2.  Revenue
  <br>3.  % Share of Pay for Show
  <br>4.  % Upgrade to annual plan
  <br>We also planned to measure LTV in the long run, if the early signs turned out positive.
  <br><br><h5>Results</h5>
  The new model worked really well for fiction. 
  <br>1. At ₹69/show, we did <b>3.3x times payments</b> compared to the control group and bagged <b>24% higher revenue</b>.
  <br>2. 6% Pay for Show users upgraded to annual plan in the 1st month. Improving this number to 10% meant offsetting the loss in annual subscribers.
  <br>3. Pay for show share was 80%
  <br><br>NF users preferred the annual plan with access to the entire library at ₹399, instead of ₹69 for a show.
  <br>1.  We did <b>27% more payments</b> compared to the control group, but achieved a <b>similar net revenue</b>. 
  <br>2.  We lost 9% annual conversion. ~22% desired upgrade rate, for offsetting this loss.
  <br>3.  Pay for show share was 25% 
  <br><br><h5>Summary</h5>
  1. We scaled this new plan for the fiction catalog to all users, at a price of ₹69/show.
  <br>2. Made improvements to improve discovery for this new plan on the show page, paywall & subscription page.
  <br>3. Planned a roadmap for further improvements, like building a capability to show this plan for only specific shows, and configuring the price for each show individually.
  <!--<br><br><h5>Update</h5>
  6 months after the release (Q2 2022), we shifted our focus from using fiction for paid user acquisition to driving engagement and retention, since the LTV remained far lower than the CAC.
